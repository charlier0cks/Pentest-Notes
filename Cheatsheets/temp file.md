## Enumerating AD

#### Credential Injection

- If we have the AD credentials in the format of username:password, we can use Runas, a legitimate Windows binary, to inject the credentials into memory. The usual Runas command would look something like this:

```
runas.exe /netonly /user:<domain>\<username> cmd.exe
```
