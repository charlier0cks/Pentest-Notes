### Precious - HTB:

>A webserver hosting a website that converts a remote webpage into a pdf.
>We discovered that the website is using a tool called pdfkit to do the conversion.
>The website has a paramater URL that is vulnerable to RCE.
>Our RCE payload consisted of a reverse shell using ruby.
>To laterally move we found valid credentials in a file for a user.
>That new user had sudo privileges for a certain command and argument.
>We were able to write specific code into a yaml file that our ruby file handled.
>This ultimately allowed us to execute commands as root.
