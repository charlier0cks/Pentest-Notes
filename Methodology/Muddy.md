808/tcp  open  ccproxy-http

Port 80:

- Nmap scan shows that it is trying to redirect us to a domain

```
80/tcp   open   http         Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.38 (Debian)
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://muddy.ugc/
```

- We can add this domain into our `/etc/hosts` file
- Footer reveals that this webapp is powered by WordPress
- This seems to be a deadend
- Wpscan tool does not find anything interesting
- 

Port 8888:

- Seems to be powered by Ladon for Python
- We discovered that there is a vulnerability for this
