## Understanding Scope, Ethics, Code of Conduct, Etc.

- [*] Scope - defines the range of assets that the organization is explicitly inviting security researchers to assess for vulnerabilities
- [*] Out-of-Scope - Refers to the assets that are explicitly off-limits for security researchers participating in the bug bounty program

#### Why is Scope Important?

- [!] Legal and Ethical Boundaries
- [!] Resource Allocation
- [!] Practical Reasons
- [!] Fairness

#### Interpreting What is In-Scope or Out-of-Scope

- [*] Rule 1: Most specific domain is the one that should be adhered to
- [I] Examples:
	- [p] In-Scope: \*.example.com
	- [c] Out-of-Scope: sub.example.com
		-> sub.example.com is out of scope
		-> www.example.com is in-scope
		-> another.sub.example.com is in-scope
	- [p] In-Scope: sub.example.com
	- [c] Out-of-Scope: \*.example.com
		-> sub.example.com is in-scope
		-> www.example.com is out of scope
		-> another.sub.example.com is out of scope
- [*] Rule 2: Wildcard (\*) character applies to none, one or more (without limit) subdomains
- [I] Example:
	- [p] In-Scope: \*.sub.example.com
		-> sub.example.com is in-scope
		-> another.sub.example.com is in-scope
		-> example.com is out of scope

#### Can You Submit OOS Bugs?

- [*] Sometimes, hunters stumble upon bugs on OOS assets
- [c] Most of the time, triage will reject these submissions
- [*] Not always the case - is there a clear business impact?
- [c] No bounty will be awarded for out-of-scope submissions

#### Duplicate Bugs

- [*] Occurs when multiple researchers report the same bug
- [*] Organizations award the bounty to the initial reporter
- [c] Knowingly reporting a duplicate report is unethical

#### Structural Issues

- [*] One fix, one reward
- [*] If multiple fixes are required, it is not a duplicate
- [*] Would the fix for the first report have fixed the others?

#### Community Code of Conduct

- [*] Disclosure Terms
- [*] Collaboration
- [*] Asking for updates
- [*] OOS Submissions
- [*] Use of illegal or cracked software
- [*] Out of bound communication
- [*] Hoarding of vulnerabilities
- [*] Data exposure and PII
- [*] Third-party services
- [*] Intrusive testing
- [*] Pivoting
- [*] Behavioral guidelines
- [*] Sanctions
- [*] Right to appeal
- [*] Responsible disclosure while restricted
- [*] International laws and sanctions list validations
- [*] Your tax and financial obligations

## Common Scoping Mistakes

#### Scoping Mistakes

- Not thoroughly reading the scope before testing
- Not strictly following the scope
- Misunderstanding the importance of scope
- Reviewing asset scope, while forgetting bug scope
- Assuming all subdomains are in-scope
- Not verifying if third-party services are in-scope
- Improperly configuring tools to adhere to scope
- Reporting out of scope findings

#### Commonly Out-of-Scope

- Physical attacks
- Social Engineering
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Outdated software
- Missing headers / cookie flags
- Brute-forcing credentials
- Username enumeration
- Fingerprinting
- Theoretical attacks
- Leaked credentials
