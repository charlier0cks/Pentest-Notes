## Understanding CVSS

- Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Rating | CVSS Score| 
| ------ | --------- |
|  None  |    0.0    |
|  Low   |  0.1-3.9  |
| Medium |  4.0-6.9  |
|  High  |  7.0-8.9  |
|Critical|  9.0-10.0 |

- CVE is for tracking vulnerabilities, while CVSS is to analyze and rate vulnerabilities
- CVSS Components
	- Base Metrics
		- The inherent qualities of a vulnerability that remain constant
		- Characteristics that contribute to the vulnerability's impact and exploitability
	- Temporal Metrics
		- The characteristics of a vulnerability that may change over time
		- Provides additional context on exploitability, remediation, etc.
	- Environmental Metrics
		- Considers the impact of the vulnerability within a specific environment
		- Considers system configuration, compensating controls, etc.

- CVSS and Bug Bounty
	- Bounties are evaluated based on the overall severity of the vulnerability
	- Researches [optionally] submit their self-calculated CVSS score
	- The CVSS may be updated by triage and/or the impacted organization
	- In case of a dispute, the bug bounty platform will provide mediation
	- Imperfect system but currently the most reliable, consistent approach
- CVSS Limitations
	- Subjectivity
	- Complexity
	- Lack of context
	- Limited scope
	- Lack of real-time updates
	- Dependency on vulnerability data
	- Misdirecting priorities risk
- CVSS Versions
	- v3
	- v4: expected to launch at the end of 2023
